The volume of a pyramid (also any cone) is \scriptstyle{V=} \tfrac{1}{3}\scriptstyle{bh} "V=1/3bh", where b is the area of the base and h the height from the base to the apex. This works for any polygon, regular or non-regular, and any location of the apex, provided that h is measured as the perpendicular distance from the plane which contains the base. In 499 AD Aryabhata, a mathematician-astronomer from the classical age of Indian mathematics and Indian astronomy, used this method in the Aryabhatiya (section 2.6).

The formula can be formally proved using calculus: By similarity, the linear dimensions of a cross section parallel to the base increase linearly from the apex to the base. The scaling factor (proportionality factor) is \scriptstyle{1 -} \tfrac{y}{h}, or \scriptstyle\tfrac{h - y}{h}, where h is the height and y is the perpendicular distance from the plane of the base to the cross-section. Since the area of any cross section is proportional to the square of the shape's scaling factor, the area of a cross section at height y is b×\tfrac{(h - y)^2}{h^2}, or since both b and h are constants \tfrac{b}{h^2}\scriptstyle (h - y)^2. The volume is given by the integral

\frac{b}{h^2} \int_0^h (h-y)^2 \, dy = \frac{-b}{3h^2} (h-y)^3 \bigg|_0^h = \tfrac{1}{3}bh.
The same equation, \scriptstyle{V=} \tfrac{1}{3}\scriptstyle{bh}, also holds for cones with any base. This can be proven by an argument similar to the one above; see volume of a cone.

For example, the volume of a pyramid whose base is an n-sided regular polygon with side length s and whose height is h is:

V = \frac{n}{12}hs^2 \cot\frac{\pi}{n}.
The formula can also be derived exactly without calculus for pyramids with rectangular bases. Consider a unit cube. Draw lines from the center of the cube to each of the 8 vertices. This partitions the cube into 6 equal square pyramids of base area 1 and height 1/2. Each pyramid clearly has volume of 1/6. From this we deduce that pyramid volume = height * base area / 3.

Next, expand the cube uniformly in three directions by unequal amounts so that the resulting rectangular solid edges are a, b and c, with solid volume abc. Each of the 6 pyramids within are likewise expanded. And—each pyramid has the same volume abc/6. Since pairs of pyramids have heights a/2, b/2 and c/2 we see that pyramid volume = height * base area / 3 again.

#The kilowatt hour (symbol kWh, kW·h, or kW h) is a derived unit of energy equal to 3.6 megajoules.[1][2]
#If the energy is being transmitted or used at a constant rate (power) over a period of time, the total energy in
#kilowatt-hours is the product of the power in kilowatts and the time in hours. 
#The kilowatt-hour is commonly used as a billing unit for energy delivered to consumers by electric utilities.

Life is an adventure, you never know what's going to happen.

Sometimes the adventure can go horribly wrong.

You can get scars and broken bones you can get hurt alot of ways on the adventure. Or the adventure can be good and you can explore new things. If you keep exploring there can be
a new you.

Some days can be dark, somedays can be light.

Life is an adventure it can be dangerous or it can be amazing. A new day is a new adventure it can be lived on.

What is 'Dark Pool Liquidity'
Dark pool liquidity is the trading volume created by institutional orders executed on private exchanges and unavailable to the public. The bulk of dark pool liquidity 
is represented by block trades facilitated away from the central exchanges. 
It is also referred to as the "upstairs market," "dark liquidity" or "dark pool."

BREAKING DOWN 'Dark Pool Liquidity'
The dark pool gets its name because details of these trades are concealed from the public, clouding the transactions like murky water. Some traders who use a strategy based on liquidity feel that dark pool liquidity should be publicized to make trading more "fair" for all parties involved.
The Emergence of Dark Pools
With the advent of supercomputers capable of executing algorithmic-based programs over the course of just milliseconds, high-frequency trading (HFT) has come to dominate daily trading volume. HFT technology allows institutional traders to execute their orders of multi-million share blocks ahead of other investors, capitalizing on fractional upticks or downticks in share prices. When subsequent orders are executed, profits are instantly obtained by HFT traders who then close out their positions. This form of legal piracy can occur dozens of times a day, reaping huge gains for HFT traders.

Eventually, HFT became so pervasive it grew increasingly difficult to execute large trades through a single exchange. Because large HFT orders had to be spread among multiple exchanges, it alerted trading competitors who could then get in front of the order and snatch up the inventory, driving up share prices. All of this occurred within milliseconds of the initial order being placed.

To avoid the transparency of public exchanges and ensure liquidity for large block trades, several of the investment banks established private exchanges, which came to be known as dark pools. For traders with large orders who are unable to place them on the public exchanges, or want to avoid telegraphing their intent, dark pools provide a market of buyers and sellers with the liquidity to execute the trade. In 2016, there are more than 50 dark pools operating in the United States, run mostly by investment banks.

Dark Pools Under Scrutiny
Although considered legal, dark pools are able to operate with little transparency. Those who have denounced HFT as an unfair advantage over other investors have also condemned the lack of transparency in dark pools, which can hide conflicts of interest. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has stepped up its scrutiny of dark pools over complaints of illegal front-running that occurs when institutional traders place their order in front of a customer’s order to capitalize on the uptick in share prices. Advocates of dark pools insist they provide essential liquidity, allowing the markets to operate more efficiently.
