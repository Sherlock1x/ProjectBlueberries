"Byte Particles Elements"  (BPE)

"Virtual Universe, Registered Byte Particle Element", a universe, registered byte particle element, that can never be directly detected, 
but whose existence does have measurable "Store of unit value"(souv) effects. Quote: "Stephen Hawking's"

The volume of a pyramid (also any cone) is \scriptstyle{V=} \tfrac{1}{3}\scriptstyle{bh} "V=1/3bh", where b is the area of the base and h the height from the base to the apex. This works for any polygon, regular or non-regular, and any location of the apex, provided that h is measured as the perpendicular distance from the plane which contains the base. In 499 AD Aryabhata, a mathematician-astronomer from the classical age of Indian mathematics and Indian astronomy, used this method in the Aryabhatiya (section 2.6).

The formula can be formally proved using calculus: By similarity, the linear dimensions of a cross section parallel to the base increase linearly from the apex to the base. The scaling factor (proportionality factor) is \scriptstyle{1 -} \tfrac{y}{h}, or \scriptstyle\tfrac{h - y}{h}, where h is the height and y is the perpendicular distance from the plane of the base to the cross-section. Since the area of any cross section is proportional to the square of the shape's scaling factor, the area of a cross section at height y is b×\tfrac{(h - y)^2}{h^2}, or since both b and h are constants \tfrac{b}{h^2}\scriptstyle (h - y)^2. The volume is given by the integral

\frac{b}{h^2} \int_0^h (h-y)^2 \, dy = \frac{-b}{3h^2} (h-y)^3 \bigg|_0^h = \tfrac{1}{3}bh.
The same equation, \scriptstyle{V=} \tfrac{1}{3}\scriptstyle{bh}, also holds for cones with any base. This can be proven by an argument similar to the one above; see volume of a cone.

For example, the volume of a pyramid whose base is an n-sided regular polygon with side length s and whose height is h is:

V = \frac{n}{12}hs^2 \cot\frac{\pi}{n}.
The formula can also be derived exactly without calculus for pyramids with rectangular bases. Consider a unit cube. Draw lines from the center of the cube to each of the 8 vertices. This partitions the cube into 6 equal square pyramids of base area 1 and height 1/2. Each pyramid clearly has volume of 1/6. From this we deduce that pyramid volume = height * base area / 3.

Next, expand the cube uniformly in three directions by unequal amounts so that the resulting rectangular solid edges are a, b and c, with solid volume abc. Each of the 6 pyramids within are likewise expanded. And—each pyramid has the same volume abc/6. Since pairs of pyramids have heights a/2, b/2 and c/2 we see that pyramid volume = height * base area / 3 again.

Life is an adventure, you never know what's going to happen.

Sometimes the adventure can go horribly wrong.

You can get scars and broken bones you can get hurt alot of ways on the adventure. Or the adventure can be good and you can explore new things. If you keep exploring there can be
a new you.

Some days can be dark, somedays can be light.

Life is an adventure it can be dangerous or it can be amazing. A new day is a new adventure it can be lived on.
